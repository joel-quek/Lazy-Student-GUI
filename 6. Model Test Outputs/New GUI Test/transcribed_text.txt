 Hi friends! Welcome to my little star alerter with my name is Ivan with SpecticTicShills and my children. Today I'm going to decide a poem named Olaf Mi. Here it goes! See my eyes, see my nose, see my fingers, see my toes, see my lips, see my knee. Now you have seen Olaf Mi. There's no one in this, all my world exactly just like me. I am the and you are the special don't you see? I do! To watch my other fun videos, please get the links, bye bye! Thank you! I love you!
